                    <h2>How to grow sunchokes</h2>
                    <p>Plant sunchokes in full sun. The sunchoke prefers loose, well-drained soil but will grow almost anywhere.
                        Add aged compost or sand to planting beds before planting; loose soil will make tuber harvesting easier.
                        The sunchoke prefers a soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2. It is best to set sunchokes in a dedicated bed; 
                        once established they will spread rapidly and may require some effort to remove.
                        The sunchoke can be planted densely to form a screen or windbreak.</p>

                    <p>Sunchoke tubers can be planted in the garden as early as 2 to 3 weeks before the average last frost date in spring.
                         They are best planted in soil that has warmed to 50°F (10°C). 
                         In warm-winter regions, sunchokes can be planted in winter. Sunchokes require 110 to 150 days to reach harvest.
                         Sunchokes grow best in temperatures ranging from 65° to 90°F (18-32°C).</p>
                    <p>Sunchokes grow best with an even, regular supply of water but can survive long periods of drought once established. 
                        Sunchokes require no extra feeding; they grow best in soil rich in organic matter.
                        Sunchoke tubers grow, divide, and easily spread. To contain sunchokes install wood, plastic, metal, 
                        or masonry barriers at least 24 inches (61cm) deep in the soil.
                        Avoid deep cultivation near sunchokes; they are shallow-rooted and spread to 18 inches (45cm) away from 
                        the main stem. Aphids may attack sunchokes. Pinch out infested foliage or hose the aphids off the plants.
                        The tubers can rot in wet soil but are generally disease-free. 
                        Plant in well-drained soil and quickly remove diseased plants.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 pound (450g) sunchokes, rinsed and trimmed of any dark spots</li>
                        <li>Kosher salt</li>
                        <li>1 &amp; 1/2 tablespoons (20ml) canola or other neutral oil </li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) unsalted butter</li>
                        <li>Large pinch freshly picked thyme leaves </li>
                        <li>Maldon, for serving</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a medium saucepan, cover sunchokes with 1 inch cold water. 
                            Season generously with salt (the water should taste nicely salted, 
                            as if you were seasoning soup). Set over high heat and bring to a boil, 
                            then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until paring knife inserted into a 
                            sunchoke meets little resistance, 
                            about 10 minutes; be careful not to overcook. </li>
                        <li>
                            Drain sunchokes using fine-mesh strainer or colander.
                            When cool enough to handle, place sunchokes on work surface or cutting board. 
                            Working 1 sunchoke at a time, use the bottom of a heavy skillet to press firmly on each 
                            sunchoke until it is flattened but not still in one piece; 
                            take care not to press so hard that the sunchokes break apart. 
                        </li>
                        <img src="images/eating.webp" alt="recipe" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
                        <li>
                            In a large cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. 
                            Add sunchokes in a single layer and cook without moving until well browned, about 3 minutes. 
                            Flip sunchokes, then add butter to the pan and allow to melt. Add half of thyme to the melted 
                            butter and continue to cook, spooning butter over sunchokes, 
                            until browned on the second side, about 3 minutes longer. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Transfer sunchokes to a serving plate and spoon the thyme butter on top. 
                            Garnish with remaining freshly picked 
                            thyme leaves and sprinkle with flaky salt. Serve immediately. 
                        </li>
